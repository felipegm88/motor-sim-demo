# Doxygen documentation

This repository uses Doxygen to generate API documentation from the code and the Markdown pages in `docs/`.

## Generate docs locally

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Then open:

- `doxygen-out/html/index.html`

Graphviz is optional but recommended for nicer diagrams and graphs.

## Hosted docs

The generated HTML is published via GitHub Pages:

- https://felipegm88.github.io/motor-sim-demo/

(For forks, replace the user/repo in the URL.)
