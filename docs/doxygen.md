# Doxygen documentation

This repository uses Doxygen to generate API documentation from the code and the Markdown pages in `docs/`.

## Generate docs locally

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Then open:

- `doxygen-out/html/index.html`

Graphviz is optional but recommended for nicer diagrams and graphs.
